The process of converting a Python object into a format
that can be easily stored or transmitted, such as a byte stream

Deserialization is the reverse process, where the stored data 
is converted back into its original Python object.

These processes are essential for tasks like saving program state, 
sending data over over a network, persisting data to a file.
