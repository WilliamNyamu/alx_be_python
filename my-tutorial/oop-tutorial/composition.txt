Composition is a much more elegant way of using method and attributes 
from a parent class in a child class

The problem with inheritance is that a child inherits all the attributes and Methods


With Composition, we can explicitly choose what is inherited from the parent class.

Composition prevents the diamond problem from occuring
Inheritance = Take everything
Composition = Take what you need, and leave the rest
