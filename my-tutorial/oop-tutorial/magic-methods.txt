Magic Methods
Magic methods are special methods in Python 
that start and end with double underscores (also known as dunder methods). 
They allow you to define specific behaviors for your objects in various 
contexts, such as arithmetic operations, comparisons, string representations, 
and more. Here are some common examples:

__str__: Defines how an object is represented as a string.
__repr__: Defines the official string representation of an object.
