Destructors (__del__):
When you create an object in Python, it occupies memory to store
its data and code. Objects are automatically destroyed (garbage collected)
by Python when they are no longer in use or when the program exits

The __del__ Method:
You can define this method in your class to perform cleanup tasks
or release resources held by the object before it is destroyed.

Important Note: Relying on destructors for critical tasks is generally not recommended 
in Python as garbage collection is not deterministic. 
Use context managers or the with statement for ensuring proper resource management.
