Abstraction is a way of modeling a real-world object or phenomenon,
limited to a specific context. The object is supposed to represent all
relevant details on this context with a high
accuracy and ignore all the rest 

For example, an Airplane class could probably exist in both a simulator and a flight booking application
But in the former case, it would hold details related to the actual flight, whereas
in the latter class you would care only about the seat map and which seats are available
