Common Exceptions:

NameError: Occurs when a variable or function is used before it's defined
TypeError: Raised when an operator is attempted on incompatible data types
IndexError: Thrown when trying to access an element outside the list or sequence's index range.
ZeroDivisionError: Occurs when attempting to divide by Zero
ValueError: Indicated an inappropriate value passed to a function or operation

try:
  # Code that might raise an exception
except ExceptionType:
  # Code to handle the exception
else:
  # Code that executes if no exception occurs
finally:
  # Code that always executes, regardless of exceptions

Creating Custom Exceptions
 - Define a new class that inherits from the base Exception class
   or its subclasses(e.g., ValueError, TypeError, etc.)
 - Optionally, you can add custom attributes or methods to your exception class based on your requirements.
